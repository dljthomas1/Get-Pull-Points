# Get-Pull-Points
This python script takes a polygon and returns n equally space points inside the the polygon. The script helps to overcome some of the request limits associated with various apis (eg. Google Places API only lets you pull 60 results, if you want pull more, you need to split your territory up into sections and pull the from multiple places within).
